Compare market trends in a side by side comparison where Google's search statistics show which is more popular. Not many people know that Google tracks what people are searching for and the volume of those searches. 
It is easy to compare markets in a visual way with this graph generator and see the past trends of public interest in those markets. 
You will be pretty shocked at which markets appear to be more popular, besides being thoroughly entertained. 
This tool will be something your financially minded audience will appreciate using and playing around with.
